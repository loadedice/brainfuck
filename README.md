# brainfuck
a shitty brainfuck interpreter written in python

to give it a program you either give the path to the file as the first argument or evoke main.py with no arguments and supply the program in stdin (1 line only)

each cell is 8 bits, there are 30,000 cells by default

### TODO
* Test it more to make sure it works when it should
* Clean up the code a bit
* Add in more comments
* Add in a debug mode
* Add in a dynamic memory option
* Add in options to change the cell size
